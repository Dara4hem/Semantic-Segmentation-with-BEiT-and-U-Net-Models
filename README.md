# Semantic Segmentation with BEiT and U-Net Models

This project implements semantic segmentation on the Semantic Drone Dataset using two models: U-Net and BEiT (Bidirectional Encoder representation from Image Transformers). The primary focus is to accurately segment aerial images to identify various elements such as buildings, trees, and roads.

## **Project Overview**

- **Dataset**: The project uses the Semantic Drone Dataset, which contains aerial images and their corresponding semantic segmentation masks.
- **Models**: The project implements two models for segmentation:
  - **U-Net**: A popular convolutional network architecture for image segmentation.
  - **BEiT**: A Transformer-based model fine-tuned for semantic segmentation.

## **Project Structure**

- **Cell 1**: Imports necessary libraries and loads the pre-trained BEiT model.
- **Cell 2**: Downloads and extracts the Semantic Drone Dataset using Kaggle API.
- **Cell 3**: Sets up the environment with additional dependencies.
- **Cell 4-6**: Prepares the dataset and splits it into training, validation, and test sets.
- **Cell 7**: Visualizes a sample image and its corresponding segmentation mask.
- **Cell 8**: Defines the `DroneDataset` class for loading and preprocessing the data.
- **Cell 9**: Installs necessary Python packages.
- **Cell 10**: Applies data augmentation techniques using Albumentations.
- **Cell 11**: Trains the BEiT model and evaluates its performance.

## **Requirements**

The project is implemented in Python and requires the following packages:

- `transformers`
- `torch`
- `torchvision`
- `albumentations`
- `PIL`
- `segmentation-models-pytorch`
- `kaggle`
- `cv2`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `tqdm`

## **Installation**

To run the project, first install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **Usage**

1. **Download the Dataset**: Ensure you have a Kaggle API token and download the dataset as shown in Cell 2.
2. **Train the Model**: Run the notebook cells sequentially to train the BEiT model on the dataset.
3. **Evaluate Performance**: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics.

## **Future Work**

- Optimize the model for better performance.
- Experiment with other transformer-based models.
- Explore real-time segmentation applications.
